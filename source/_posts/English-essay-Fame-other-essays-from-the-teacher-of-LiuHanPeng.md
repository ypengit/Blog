### <center>Fame — Good or Evil?</center>

Fame, a notion which humankind constantly covet1s since ancient times, has such a meaning to individuals. Whereas, every coin has two sides. The opinion concerning what the fame actually brought to us varies from person to person.

First and foremost, with certain benefits, prestige is regarded as the emblem of success. To name merely a few, fame enables one to emerge in the view of public as well as being prevalent. Additionally, once a person enjoys the reputation, he subsequently inclines to derive much more opportunities. Notably, it is this opportunity that brings them further extol, esteem, money, and so forth. In crude terms, fame and success, to some extent, while remain a positive correlation.

Nevertheless, manifest as it is, we shouldn't omit the demerit of fame, neither. Striving for prestige has a trend to lead characters to a misperception, which is pursuing fame without virtues. Provided that it forms an unscrupulous ethos among the entire society, it would be destructive for the whole country.

From my perspective, I take a more optimistic stand on this topic. Hence, I reckon fame as a decent affair. On the one hand, unscrupulous people are merely in a tiny proportion, the majority of us still possess an upright worldview. On the other hand, in a society, at any rate we do need some celebrated individuals to lead public opinion. Otherwise, our society will be trapped in a mess. Consequently, whether fame good or evil hinges on how we utilize it.

### <center>Fame — Good or Evil?</center>

Fame, an attractive word which means the popularity you gain among individuals, seems more and more vital with the development of modern society. The acceleration of technology improvement also magnifies the effect of being famous. Nevertheless, every coin has two sides. We are likely to find it hard to roughly jump to a conclusion that fame is good or evil, as it really has its positive aspects and the negative ones.
 
The advantages of fame are apparent and full of allure. For instance, it gives a person the public influence which is able to improve his social position and make him rich. It brings pleasance and satisfaction which the majority of people are seeking for, too. Imagine that well-known corporations and media surround you and take pains to please you, and you will understand the secret why being famous is an excellent change that is worth pursuing in the course of the rest of life. There are some other reasons you can list, such as showing your relatives and friends you are more than they thought you were, demonstrating excellence in some field, being respectable, etc.

The double-edged sword means that we ought to admit its disappointing disadvantages while enjoying the happiness which fame brings us. You may feel nervous and a bit annoyed provided that you are conscious of many eyes focus on you. Similarly, thousands of celebrities grumble that they are under great stress for the continuing attention from the public. Lots of media even instruct the news reporters to shoot them while they are having dinner with their family members in an ordinary restaurant, which disrupts their privative time as well as enhances the stress they feel. Another disadvantage is that being famous can be criticized vehemently by society if you do something wrong. The reason is that fame amplifies the impact of one's behavior.
 
As far as I'm concerned, though being famous may has lots of disadvantages, we are not expected to be scared or be hostile to fame, for its advantages have more powerful effect. Thomas Edison, one of the famous inventors in 20th century, believed fame brought him motivation to achieve greater success. In a word, reputation is still a target which motivates us to work industriously. If you do gain publicity, hang on for dear life. You will soon find that renown makes you strive harder to succeed and believe in yourself.
